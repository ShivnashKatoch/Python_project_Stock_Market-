# Python_project_Stock_Market 
- Fetches any stocks current graph according to the ticker
- Made using python programing and with the help of yfinance library
The provided code demonstrates how to fetch and display the current graph of a stock using its ticker symbol in Python. The code        utilizes the yfinance library, which provides a convenient way to access financial data from Yahoo Finance. By specifying the desired stock ticker symbol, the fetch_stock_graph() function fetches the stock data using the yf.Ticker() function. It then retrieves the historical data for the past 1 day using the history() method. The closing prices from the retrieved data are plotted on a graph using the plot() function from the matplotlib.pyplot module. The graph is customized with appropriate labels, title, and grid lines. Finally, the show() function is called to display the graph. To use the code, simply replace the ticker_symbol variable with the desired stock ticker symbol and run the program. This code provides a quick and straightforward way to visualize the current stock graph, allowing for easy analysis and interpretation of the stock's recent performance.
